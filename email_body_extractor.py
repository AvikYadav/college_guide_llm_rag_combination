    # IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE:
    # 1. DO NOT hardcode your password directly in the script in a real application.
    #    Use environment variables or a secure vault.
    # 2. For Gmail, you MUST enable 2-Factor Authentication and then create an
    #    "App Password". Using your regular Google password will NOT work and is
    #    less secure.
